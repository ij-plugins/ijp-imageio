----------------------
IJ-JAI-ImageIO v.1.0.4
----------------------

Bug fix: Pixel values of 16 bit images are not saved - saved images have 
         all pixels set to zero.

Bug fix: ClassCastException thrown when saving 'inch' as a calibration 
         unit in TIFF images. Problem caused by obscure JAI IO 'feature': 
         unsigned short TIFF Tags are represented as 'char's.
