----------------------
IJ-JAI-ImageIO v.1.1.0
----------------------

Enhancement: JAI Reader and JAI Writer plugins support scripting through
             Image/J macros; both work well with Macro Recorder (tested
	     with Image/J 1.29x).
	     
Enhancement: JAI Reader with Preview plugin can combine multiple files 
             into a stack.	     

----------------------
IJ-JAI-ImageIO v.1.0.5
----------------------

Bug fix: Saving of 2-bit images, that is images that have only two entries
         in the color map (Note: 2-bit compression is not implemented yet).

----------------------
IJ-JAI-ImageIO v.1.0.4
----------------------

Bug fix: Pixel values of 16 bit images are not saved - saved images have 
         all pixels set to zero.

Bug fix: ClassCastException thrown when saving 'inch' as a calibration 
         unit in TIFF images. Problem caused by obscure JAI IO 'feature': 
         unsigned short TIFF Tags are represented as 'char's.            

----------------------
IJ-JAI-ImageIO v.1.0.3
----------------------

JAI Reader with Preview now offers option to open only selected pages
(images) for files containing multiple pages (images).

----------------------
IJ-JAI-ImageIO v.1.0.2
----------------------

This version provides a temporary fix for reading images with less
then 8 bits per pixel. Permanent fix will come with next release.

----------------------

----------------------

Optimized JAIFileFilter performance: improved filtering time and
eliminated occurrence of InterruptedIOException.
