===================================
 BUILDING ij-ImageIO PLUGIN BUNDLE
===================================

------------
PRESEQUISITS
------------
 
  * Java compiler, tested with Sun Java 1.4.+ (http://java.sun.com)
    - tested v.1.4.2 and 1.5.0
    
  * Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
    - tested with 1.5.4
    
  * If you got source code from CVS you may also need the Sun's uncommitted 
    source code for JAI 1.1.1 codecs (the disribution source code comes with
    all dependent libraries included). Note that source code is automatically 
    checked out by Ant while building 'dist-from-cvs' target.
    - To check it out manually checked out following instructions at
      http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=44711
      Look for module named Sun_JAI_Sample_IO_Source_Code_v_1_1_1
    - If checking out and building manually, modify value of "jaicodec.jar" 
      property in build.xml script.
