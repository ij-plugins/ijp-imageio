<p>
    Library for interoperability between Java ImageIO and ImageJ.
    Supports for reading, writing, and converting between Java2D and ImageJ image formats.
    Also implements <a href="https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-imageio">IJP-ImageIO</a> plugin bundle.
    The library adds to ImageJ support for additional image file formats and their variants. Most important
    additions include:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Extended TIFF support</li>

    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading of compressed and tiled TIFF files</li>

            <li>Reading of TIFF images with 1 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit,
                and float pixel formats from compressed and tiled files. Images are converted
                to closest corresponding ImageProcessor representation.
            </li>

            <li>Saving as compressedTIFF; supports Packbit, JPEG, and ZLib compression.</li>

            <li>Saving of binary images in 1 bit compressed TIFF format. Compared to
                saving as uncompressed 8bit images can get 1:100 or higher
                compression ratios.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Correct reading of 16bit PNG images (without conversion to 8 bit)</li>

    <li>Saving in PNG format, includes support for compression.</li>

    <li>Saving in PNM format</li>

    <li>Any other format that supported by Java ImageIO, depending on available service providers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Image I/O plugins can read/write image calibration information from TIFF files.
    Standard TIFF image calibration tags are supported (X_RESOLUTION, Y_RESOLUTION, RESOLUTION_UNIT).</p>

<p>Using standard dependencies IJP-ImageIO can read and write images in BMP, GIF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PCX, PNG, PNM, TIFF,
    and WBMP formats. It will also use any additional ImageIO service providers available in the class path</p>
