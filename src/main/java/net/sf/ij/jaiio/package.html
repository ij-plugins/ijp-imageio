<p>Image I/O library implements core functionality of <a href=
        "http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/plugins/imageio">ij-plugins&nbsp;
    Image I/O bundle</a>. The library adds to ImageJ support for
    additional image file formats and their variants. Most important
    additions include:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Extended TIFF support</li>

    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold"><b>Reading of compressed and tiled TIFF
                files</b></span></li>

            <li><span class="bold"><span class="bold"><b>Reading of TIFF
                images with 1 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, and float pixel formats
                from compressed and tiled files</b></span>. Images are converted
to closest corresponding ImageProcessor representation (). Note
that related set of <a href=
                    "http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/jimi.html" target="_top">JIMI
                plugins</a> converts all images to 8 bit images (ByteProcessor)
regardless of their actual pixel formats and does not support
tiled images.</span></li>

            <li><span class="bold"><span class="bold"><b>Saving as compressed
                TIFF</b></span>; supports Packbit, JPEG, and ZIP compression.
Saving with LZW compression is not supported for the usual reason
of the patent on the algorithm.</span></li>

            <li><span class="bold"><span class="bold"><b>Saving of binary
                images in 1 bit compressed TIFF format</b></span>. Compared to
saving as uncompressed 8bit images can get 1:100 or higher
compression ratios.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><span class="bold"><span class="bold"><b>Correct reading of
        16bit PNG images</b></span> (without conversion to 8
bit)</span></li>

    <li><span class="bold"><span class="bold"><b>Saving in PNG
        format</b></span>, includes support for compression.</span></li>

    <li><span class="bold"><span class="bold"><b>Saving in PNM
        format</b></span>.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Image I/O plugins can read/write image calibration information
    from TIFF files. Standard TIFF image calibration tags are
    supported (X_RESOLUTION, Y_RESOLUTION, RESOLUTION_UNIT).</p>

<p>Additionally Image I/O can read images in BMP, FlashPiX, GIF,
    JPEG, PNG, and PNM formats; and save images in BMP, and JPEG
    formats.</p>

<p>Image I/O makes use of <a href=
        "http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/index.html" target=
        "_top">Java Advance Imaging</a> (JAI) codecs released by SUN as
    <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/sampsource/jai/"
       target="_top">uncommitted source code for JAI 1.1.1 codecs</a> .
    The plugin bundle is completely self contained. All used codec
    classes are included in the bundle and there is no need to
    install JAI itself to use the bundle.</p>
